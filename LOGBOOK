Fullrun14: mumudz fixed 			- NO JET SMEARING
Fullrun15: mumudz with m(mu,mu) > 45. GeV	- NO JET SMEARING
Fullrun16: mumudz without m(mu,mu), vtx_n < 11
Fullrun17: mumudz without m(mu,mu) > 45. GeV
Fullrun18: zmass window 10 - 80
Fullrun19: TTjets v2 sample
Fullrun20: delta_vtx_z
Fullrun21: Stage + mumudz before tight selection
Fullrun22: last_mumudz + rebin of delta_vtx_z
Fullrun23: rebin again + all muons
Fullrun24: tight->loose_muons
Fullrun25: delta z between 2 closest vtx and only 2 tight muons
Fullrun27: First run with systematics
Fullrun26: Attempt for old systematics
Fullrun28: Default run without systematics
Fullrun29: Muon relIso = 0.5 run without systematics
Fullrun30: First run after Analysis
Fullrun31: PFJetSmearing with gen jet smearing
Fullrun32: PFJetSmearing with reco jet smearing
Fullrun38: trigger matched histogram with working triggers & ttbar mcatnlo
Fullrun39: more trigger matched histograms & ttbar mcatnlo correctly implemented
Fullrun40: reduced triggerset to only Mu17_TkMu8
Fullrun41: 2 leading jet btag histograms, b-tag efficiency single bin histograms
Fullrun42: b-tag efficiency pt,eta histograms
Fullrun43: new ttbar sample, TT_C10...
Fullrun44: fixed 2 leading jet to 2 leading btag jets, and new TT_C10 efficiency maps
Fullrun45: JER_calc = true run
Fullrun46: Used JER_center (turned out to be bullshit)
Fullrun47: Fixed B-Tagging algorithm (upgrading from L->M, now properly from veto->tag), absolute value of eta for eff map, changed seeding for TRandom

TODO:
- Fix trigger selection to take one OR multiple trigger names

OPTIONAL:
- Systematics for b-tag efficiency: variable bin, rescale with eta projection fit to project p_T more consistently
